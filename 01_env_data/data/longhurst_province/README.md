Takes a tsv file in format sampleID\tlatitude\tlongitude\n" and 
returns an output with with Longhurst codes and the description of
the Longhurst Province where the coordinate is located. It works by parsing a file that
contains lat/long coordinates that bound each province and performing the Crossings Test
on each province.  The Crossings Test is used in computer graphics to quickly
determine if a point is within or outside a polygon by "drawing" a line east from the
input coordinate and seeing how many crossings the line makes with the polygon border.
If there is an odd number of crossings, the point is within the polygon, otherwise the
point is outside the polygon.

## coord2longhurst.py
```python
python coord2longhurst.py 45 -138
```

Returns:
`45.0 N,  -138.0 E -->   NPPF 	 Westerlies - N. Pacific Polar Front Province`

## coord2longhurst_batch.py
```python
python coord2longhurst_batch.py 2longhurst.tsv longhurst_codes.tsv
```
Returns:
`S0001	49.7225	-42.4467	NADR	Westerlies	N. Atlantic Drift Province (WWDR)
...
S0008	46.312	-39.658	NADR	Westerlies	N. Atlantic Drift Province (WWDR)
...`
